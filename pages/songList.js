        title: 'Just Give Me Jesus',
        lyrics: 'I work so hard, tryna open every door, Search near and far, turning over every stone I close my eyes, instead I find no rest, No rest for a restless heart. All I have been chasing, putting my faith in. Let it fade, let it break into pieces. Just give me Jesus (Jesus). Just give me Jesus (Jesus), There is nothing I desire (I desire). That cannot be found in You (found in You). You are everything that I have ever needed. Just give me Jesus (oh-ohh, oh-oh-ohhh).Take all my pride, my dreams, my plans. This house I have built, on troubled sand. If I gained the world, it would never be, It could never be enough. Just give me Jesus (Jesus). Just give me Jesus (Jesus). There is nothing I desire (I desire). That cannot be found in You (found in You). You are everything that I have ever needed. Just give me Jesus (Jesus). Oh, just give me Jesus (Jesus). All of my searching, trying to be perfect. All the fears, all the lies I believed in All I have been chasing, putting my faith in Let it fade, let it fall into pieces Yeah-yeahh! And just give me Jesus You are life, You are hope Just give me Jesus, You are love, You are all that I want, There is nothing I desire (I desire). That cannot be found in You (found in You). You are everything that I have ever needed. Just give me Jesus (Jesus),Just give me Jesus (Jesus). There is nothing I desire (I desire). That cannot be found in You (found in You). You are everything that I have ever needed. Just give me Jesus,Just give me Jesus',

        title: 'Dada sy Neny',
        lyrics: 'Iza no tiako i dada sy neny Fanontaniana tsy valiko ireny Fantatro fa tsisy tombo sy hala i neny no tiako fa i dada malala. Tiako avokoa ary tiako tokoa. Tsy mba avy eo imolotra fa avy ao am-po. Tsy misy mahasolo ny vitan ny neny. Kanefa tsy feno raha tsy eo i dada  Ref: Anisan ny olona tena tsy foiko i neny. I dada ihany koa efa olona tiako hatrizay. Ny ahy ny angatahako hananan ireo tombon andro. Mba ho ela velona ireo nahitako masoandro.  (2x) Endrey ireto izy efa osa tokoa Ny volony fotsy, efa sola ny loha Indrisy nilaozany ny hatanorany Izany tokoa no fiainana an-tany. Izaho aza mba efa an-taonany maro. Fa misy kamboty amam-bolana ihany. Mba mibadabada vao miana-miteny. Lahatra tsy hiodivirana ireny',

        title: 'Before You',
        lyrics: 'There were no pictures, there were no colors. There was no story, my soul mate. There were no parties, I was not in the mood for anything. No smile, my soul mate. You know, the world did not run smoothly. I had the words but not the song. You know love, you know passion. Yes, it is meant to be, it was said. Yes, that is life.   [Chorus]    Before you. I had nothing. Before you. I was not shown the way. I know God does not blame me. For laying eyes on you. Before you, I was not shown the way. There were no houses, there was no happiness, I had no reason, my soul mate. There was no laughter, but there was no crying. I was alone here, my soul mate. You know, the world did not run smoothly. I had the words but not the song, You know love in any ways, Yes, it is meant to be, it was said. Yes, that is life.',
